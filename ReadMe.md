# HW Mod 18


For this module, we build an application that can document transactions on the blockchain.  The blockchain ledger system is a scalable application that can be used in banking, trading, and insurance.  It allows users to send and receive funds via cryptocurrency and creates a public ledger record.


---

## Technologies
---
Built on Python, this application makes use of the Streamlit GUI protocol to handle user inputs.  It also structures a blackchain dataclass that can be expanded for necessary use cases.  

## Installation Guide
---
This project requires multiple imports of various  Python packages related to blockchain.  They can be imported via pip and include: streamlit, dataclasses, haslib, and pandas.

## Examples
---
A case example of landing page before transactions.  User is ask to input the sender and receivers names.  It also asks for how much is being sent.  Once entered, a blockchain ledger is created.

## Results

We run 3 test transactions to make sure that the application is working.  We then doa "Validation Test" to verify the hash on the blockchains

## Summary

This scalable ledger application generates a public ledger and handles the basic inputs and outputs necessary including the sender, receiver, and quantity of crypto transferred.  It can be expanded to create multiple trasanctions and handle smart contracts.
